# Nonlinear_Regression
Non-linear regressions are a relationship between independent variables  洧논  and a dependent variable  洧녽  which result in a non-linear function modeled data. Essentially any relationship that is not linear can be termed as non-linear, and is usually represented by the polynomial of  洧녲  degrees (maximum power of  洧논 ).

 洧녽=洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬 
 
Non-linear functions can have elements like exponentials, logarithms, fractions, and others. For example:
洧녽=log(洧논)
 
Or even, more complicated such as :
洧녽=log(洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬)
